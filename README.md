# Implementing-2-D-convolution-and-2-D-FFT-functions-from-Scratch
* For 2D Convolution, I created a separate padding from scratch which implements 4 different types of padding (clip/zero-padding, wrap around, copy edge, and
reflect across edge) and then tested the convolution function on various types of filters.
* For 2D FFT, I used an inbuilt 1-D FFT function to implement the 2D FFT and used the 2D FFT function to create a 2D IFFT function.
